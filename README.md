# Engineering 4 Notebook
by Max and Elijah

## Hello Python
### Objectives
We're finally done with arduino (for the time being atleast)! Now . For this assignment, we had to create an automatic dice roller, [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Dice_roll.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned the basics of how to code Python on a Rasberry Pi. This will be very useful for the rest of the assignments. Also, we learned how to generate random numbers with python.

## Calculator
### Objectives
Now that we know how to use basic Python, we can create a very simple program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, and modulos. The simple calculator can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Calculator.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to do simple math with python. We will need this later for data manipulation.

## Quadrativ Solver
### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to apply the math we learned in the previous assignment, and make a program that can solve a quadratic givin a,b, and c of a quadratic equations. The code can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Quadratic_solver.py)
### Lessons
During this lesson, we learned how to apply the math we had previously learned to actual problems that we may need to solve in the future.

## Strings and Loops 
### Objectives
For this assignment,we had to take a user inputed sentence, break it up letter by letter,a dn print out each letter on a new line. The strings and loops python script can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Words_and_Strings.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to use and manipulate strings in python. String manipulation and data type manipulation in python is surprisingly easy, and essential to any assignment dealing with user input.

## Hangman
### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to code a hangman game. The script for the hangman game can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Hangman.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to think through and build a game with code, considering each step of the game and how to make the whole thing playable. This was the most challenging assignment we've had to do so far. and taught us how to use string manipulation, lists, and logic all together in a python program

## GPIO Python
### Objetives
For this assignment, we had to turn two LEDs on and off with a python program. The script for using GPIO with Python can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Led_Test.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to use the RPi.GPIO library in python to control circuits that we build.
