# Engineering 4 Notebook
by Max and Elijah

## Hello Python
### Objectives
We're finally done with arduino (for the time being atleast)! Now . For this assignment, we had to create an automatic dice roller, [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Dice_roll.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned the basics of how to code Python on a Rasberry Pi. This will be very useful for the rest of the assignments. Also, we learned how to generate random numbers with python.

## Calculator
### Objectives
Now that we know how to use basic Python, we can create a very simple program that adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, and modulos. The simple calculator can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Calculator.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to do simple math with python. We will need this later for data manipulation.

## Quadratic Solver
### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to apply the math we learned in the previous assignment, and make a program that can solve a quadratic givin a,b, and c of a quadratic equations. The code can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Quadratic_solver.py)
### Lessons
During this lesson, we learned how to apply the math we had previously learned to actual problems that we may need to solve in the future.

## Strings and Loops 
### Objectives
For this assignment,we had to take a user inputed sentence, break it up letter by letter,a dn print out each letter on a new line. The strings and loops python script can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Words_and_Strings.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to use and manipulate strings in python. String manipulation and data type manipulation in python is surprisingly easy, and essential to any assignment dealing with user input.

## Hangman
### Objectives
For this assignment, we had to code a hangman game. The script for the hangman game can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Hangman.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to think through and build a game with code, considering each step of the game and how to make the whole thing playable. This was the most challenging assignment we've had to do so far. and taught us how to use string manipulation, lists, and logic all together in a python program

## GPIO Python
### Objetives
For this assignment, we had to turn two LEDs on and off with a python program. The script for using GPIO with Python can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/LED_Test.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to use the RPi.GPIO library in python to control circuits that we build.

## Flask with GPIO pins
### Objetives
For this assignment, we had to use flask, a library that allows you to build interactive websites solely using python and some HTML. We had to build a website with two buttons that controlled two LEDs. The Python script for this can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/flask_gpio/app.py) and the HTML script can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Flask/flask_gpio/templates/index.html)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how to build a website with HTML, and support it with FLask. Also, we learned how to read data from the website, and use that to control GPIO pins.

## I2C with GPIO pins
### Objetives
For this assigment, we had to use an accelerometer and an LED screen. Then we had to display the X, Y, & Z accelerations on the screen, The code for this can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/I2C.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learend how to use the I2C protocol on the pi. We also learned how to hook up and control an accelerometer and an LED screen. These two pieces of tech, especially the accelerometer, will be essential in building our pi in the sky, and tracking data.

## Headless
### Objetives
For this assigment, we had to use an accelerometer to record the X acceleration data of the pi. We then had to display this data in a line graph that moved as more data points were added. Finally, we had to get this program to run when the pi started up, and make the pi run on a battery so that we could walk around the engineering lab without it being plugged into anything. The code for this can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Headless.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we figured out how to store the accelerometers data, and how to display the data in an animated line graph (which was surprisingly easy). We also learned how to use crontab to make our code run on the pi's startup. This "headless" pi is basically the base to any data recording pi in the sky.

## Pi camera
### Objetives
For this assigment, we had to use the pi camera and PiCamera() library to take pictures with different filters and record a video. The three mini assignments for this can be found here: [Starting camera preview](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test01.py), [Looping through image effects and taking pictures](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test02.py), [Recording video](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/camera_test03.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learend how to use pi camera and take pictures with it. Also, we learned how to manipulate the pictures and record videos.

## Hack your stuff
### Objetives
For this assigment, we had to take apart a beeper that uses a switched to be turned on and off. Next, we had to "hack it" so that we could control the beeper with the pi. We did this by adding a relay between the batteries and one side of the switch so tat we could control whether it was getting power. The controlling code can be [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/beeper.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned how use a relay in order to control normal items with the pi. We also learned how to hack the beeoer so that we could turn it on and off, which may be useful for the pi in the sky if we ever need to locate it.
