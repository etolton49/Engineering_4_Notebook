# Engineering 4 Notebook
## by Max and Elijah

## Hello Python
### Objectives
We're finally done with arduino (for the time being atleast)! Now . For this assignment, we had to create an automatic dice roller, [found here](https://github.com/etolton49/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/master/Python/Dice_roll.py)
### Lessons
During this assignment, we learned the basics of how to code Python on a Rasberry Pi. This will be very useful for the rest of the assignments. Also, we learned how to generate random numbers with python.
